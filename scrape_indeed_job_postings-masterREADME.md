# Indeed as a proxy for Job Demand: The Impact of Covid-19 on the Job Market

Just like the rest of America, New York City’s job market has been upended by Covid-19. In April of 2020, private sector jobs in New York City fell by 885,000, or 21.8%. However, Covid-19 also resulted in an increased demand for essential workers. With this in mind, we wanted to understand how the pandemic is affecting the job market, it’s impact on the different job sectors, and what companies are still hiring. To do this, we looked at Indeed job postings as a proxy for jobs in demand.

Files
